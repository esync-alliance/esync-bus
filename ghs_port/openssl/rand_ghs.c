 * The following algorithm repeatedly samples the real-time clock (RTC) to

 * uneven execution speed of the code (due to factors such as cache misses,
 * interrupts, bus activity, and scheduling) and upon the rather large
 * relative difference between the speed of the clock and the rate at which
 * it can be read.
 *
 * If this code is ported to an environment where execution speed is more
 * constant or where the RTC ticks at a much slower rate, or the clock can be
 * read with fewer instructions, it is likely that the results would be far
 * more predictable.
